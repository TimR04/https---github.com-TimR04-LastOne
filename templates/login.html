Login Page Template

- This template provides the structure for the "Anmeldung" (Login) page of the My Book App.
- It allows users to enter their username and password to authenticate and access their account.
- The template extends a base navigation layout and customizes the content block with a login form.
- The form requires users to input their username and password and then submits these credentials via a POST request to the '/login' endpoint for authentication.
- Proper input validation is ensured through the `required` attribute on the username and password fields, which prompts users to fill in the fields before submitting.
- If the login is successful, the user is redirected to the appropriate page; otherwise, feedback will be managed by the backend.


    Test 1 Successful Login:
    - Description: Check that a user with valid credentials is authenticated and redirected correctly.
    - Expected Outcome: The user is redirected to the homepage.

    Test 2 Invalid Credentials:
    - Description: Verify that invalid credentials result in an error message.
    - Expected Outcome: The system shows an error message without redirecting.
